***STORY:
Your base is under attack from enemy tanks.  You must defend it 
while attempt to destroy all enemy forces and still remain alive 
yourself.


***GOAL:
You have one tank, and only one life.  You must defend your base 
from being destroyed by enemy tanks that spawn from red crosses.  
You can destroy enemy tanks by firing on them, and the enemies 
will be spawning until a certain number dictated by the map.  Once 
you have destroyed all enemies, you will win the game.


***TILE:
Each tile represent something different.  Rock tiles slow the 
speed down while road tiles increase the speed.  Water prevents 
tanks from crossing.  Walls and steel walls block the way, but 
can be destroyed.
[TIP]: You can destroy a whole block of walls if you shoot point-
blank at it.


***DIRECTIONS:

-Use the direction pads to move up, down, left and right.
-Use spacebar to fire.
-Press p to pause or unpause the game.


***PROSPECTUS

Tank Wars

A game based on the original NES game Battle City, where 
the player controls a tank to duel it out with other tanks.  
The goal is to defeat all enemies (who are also tanks) 
while making sure that the main base is not destroyed.  


END FEATURES:

-Player control tank.  Animation with direction control.
-Different terrains and walls, animated.  More details below.
-Enemy tanks with AI.
-Score system
-Different maps.  Maps can be made with a 2d array to be 
stored inside a text file to be imported.

1. Tank, the player controls the tank with either WASD or the 
direciton pad.  A health system may be implemented, but the 
reason why the original game was so fun was because it didn't 
turn into long, tug-of-war style gameplay, and instant death 
from enemy missiles was one of the important factors for it.  
The tank will be animated when moving (tractor drawn 
differently).

2. Terrain will be different tile to tile.  There are 2 types 
of basic terrains, passable and not.  Passable include regular 
tiles, Road tiles (allow tanks to travel faster), forest tiles 
(camouflages the tank due to the way it is drawn over the tank 
image), and Rock tiles (tanks are slowed down).  Non-passable 
terrains include walls (may be broken by couple of shots), Steel 
walls (can only be broken by heavy firepower), and water tile 
(cannot be crossed over except with certain powerups).
EXTRA: More tiles with more directional animation, such as walls 
breaking off depending on where the missile hit it.

3. The enemy tanks, like the player tanks, will be animated.
